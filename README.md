# Introduction

Ng-Matero is an Angular admin templete made with Material components.

The original intention of developing ng-matero is to provide a high-quality and high-customized admin template based on Angular Material and to provide some more convenient business command based on Schematics.

The framework is not very mature at present, all aspects need to be improved.

# Grid Class

Ng-Matero provides a grid which similar to Bootstrap grid that source code in `styles/grid`. The grid class is optional. You can choose any grid class you like, such as Bootstrap, Foundation, Semantic, etc.

The grid breakpoints for Ng-Matero are the same as the default breakpoints for flex-layout.

| breakpoint | mediaQuery |
| :--- | :--- |
| xs | 'screen and \(max-width: 599px\)' |
| sm | 'screen and \(min-width: 600px\) and \(max-width: 959px\)' |
| md | 'screen and \(min-width: 960px\) and \(max-width: 1279px\)' |
| lg | 'screen and \(min-width: 1280px\) and \(max-width: 1919px\)' |
| xl | 'screen and \(min-width: 1920px\) and \(max-width: 5000px\)' |

It is used exactly the same way as Bootstrap except that the responsive breakpoints.
